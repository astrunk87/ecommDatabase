## description
 I created this project to help an ecomm busniess be able to have an easier to use database, that is easily updated
 By creating this project it is easier for this business to be able to keep track of products they have and update the information related to that product
 I learned how to make routes to all the tables that i created and how to use a through table. I also gained a better understanding of sequalize.

## Installation
  to install this program you will need to copy over the files and run an npm install.

## usage
  Once you have done that you will ned to open a terminal in the schema.sql file, log in to mysql, then source the schema. After that open a different terminal in the server.js file and do an npm run seed, once it has seeded you can now do npm start and it will load the database and you can modify it using insomina.
